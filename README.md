We are making the world a better place every day. With emoji. :punch:

UPDATE: It is now compulsory for all commit messages to have emoji! :fire:

# Build process:
- Make sure that you have copied all new emoji to the emoji/160x160/ folder
- Run src/createCSS.py and copy the contents from the destination file to css/emojikit.css without replacing the top bit
- run src/resize_emoji.py to resize and copy all the emoji from the 160x160 to all other size folders.
