We are making the world a better place every day. With emoji. :punch:

UPDATE: It is now compulsory for all commit messages to have emoji! :fire:

# Build process:
- Run src/createCSS.py (This adds any new classes to css/emojikit.css)
- run src/resize_emoji.py (This resizes all the emoji in emoji/160x160 to the relevant sizes and copies them to the relevant folders)
